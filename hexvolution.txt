hexvolution

cell traits:
	health (fixed, double, 100.0)
	strength - attack strength 0.0-1.0
	regen rate
	adjacency bonus
	reproduction rate
	energy consumption - proportional to all stats
	metabolism rate - ability to collect energy from food sources
	energy transfer efficiency - how much remaining energy is distributed

all colonies start on a food source
available energy per turn is distributed starting from food sources
damage per turn = enemy strength - regen
when a new cell is produced, its stats will be within the range of the stats of adjacent cells of the same species
mutation will apply a random modifier to a random stat upon reproduction
